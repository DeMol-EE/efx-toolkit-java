# EFX Toolkit 0.1.0 Release Notes

This is the first release of the EFX toolkit, a Java library for the [eForms Expression Language (EFX)](https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/efx)

The EFX Toolkit for Java developers is a library that enables the transpilation of EFX expressions and templates to different target languages. It also provides an implementation that turns an EFX expression into XPath.

The documentation is available at: https://docs.ted.europa.eu/eforms/latest/efx-toolkit

This version depends on the eForms SDK version 0.6.0, and uses the EFX grammar that it provides.
